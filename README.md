3. Serverless Web Application with AWS Integration: The application architecture uses **Amazon S3** to host the static web resources including our **ReactJS** based frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files). The application is loaded by the user's browser and interacts with our API layer built using, **AWS AppSync**. AppSync provides realtime query capability to search for the list of travel destinations stored in **Amazon DynamoDB**. AppSync makes it easy to combine data from **AWS Lambda** to provide realtime weather information for each destination.
